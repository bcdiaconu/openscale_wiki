To gain your wger REST API Key log into https://wger.de and go to `About this software -> Rest API` then on the right side you see a button `Generate API Key` click on it and copy your API Key into openScale sync.

_Note:_
_Wger only supports one measurement a day. If you have more weight measurements in openScale on one day, only the first one are synchronized to wger._
